# wd2ca2

The bash program which resizes an image to a given width.

How to use it in the command line?

1. First argument is a path to image.
2. Second argument is a width. 
3. The output will be an image in the following format: originalFileNameGivenWidth.originalExtension

Remember! If you do not include the desired width, the image will be converted by default. So width will be 100px.
